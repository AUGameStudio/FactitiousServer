If he needed to be seen seated, they reportedly covered his legs with blankets or pillows, as was the case at the 1945 Yalta Conference, when assistants draped 11 wool shawls over his lap before he posed with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin.",

The young man\u2019s health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.\n\nMr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.\n\nThe young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work.

But, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to say, \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your own opinion, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own facts.\u201d \n\nSoon after the shooting death of Michael Brown, this 285-pound young man was depicted as a \u201cgentle giant.\u201d But, after a video was leaked, showing him bullying the owner of a store from which he had stolen some merchandise, Attorney General Eric Holder expressed displeasure that the video was leaked. In other words, to Holder the truth was offensive, but the lie it exposed was not. \nMany people who claimed to have been eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting gave opposite accounts of what happened. Some even gave accounts that contradicted what they themselves had said earlier. Fortunately, the grand jury did not have to rely on such statements, though some in the media seemed to. What the grand jury had, that the rest of us did not, was a set of physical facts that told a story that was independent of what anybody said. \n\nThe physical evidence was hard to square with the assertions that Brown was shot in the back, or was shot with his hands up, while trying to surrender. But it was consistent with the policeman\u2019s testimony. Moreover, the physical facts were consistent with what a number of black witnesses said under oath, despite expressing fears for their own safety for contradicting what those in the rampaging mobs were saying.\n\nWhy some people insist on believing whatever they want to believe is a question that is hard to answer.

In other words, to Holder the truth was offensive, but the lie it exposed was not. \nMany people who claimed to have been eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting gave opposite accounts of what happened. Some even gave accounts that contradicted what they themselves had said earlier. Fortunately, the grand jury did not have to rely on such statements, though some in the media seemed to. What the grand jury had, that the rest of us did not, was a set of physical facts that told a story that was independent of what anybody said.",
